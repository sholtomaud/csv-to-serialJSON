# CSV-to-serialJSON

Turns a CSV of requirements into a json file which can be rendered as a serialised [Gaffa-js](https://github.com/gaffa-tape/gaffa-js) view

## Use Case

You need to gather application requirements from a client.

JSON might be the most code-friendly format, however an uninitiated viewer will generally be more familiar with CSV.

So long as the CSV follows the [required format](), you should get a serialised json view that can be consumed by Gaffa-js
